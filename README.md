# instagram-profile-picture

I have used python to open and also download Instagram profile pictures as because Instagram does not allow us to open the picture.

## use

Clone the repository and run the **main.py** file and enter a valid **username** as input.

## requirements
For running this, you need to have python3 installed in your system.

after that run the command
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

This will install all the necessary libraries required for this.
